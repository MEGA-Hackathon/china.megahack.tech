Now, I have a better understanding of the new possibilities of programming in the cultural industry, and understand that through digital language, programming can spark new sparks in digital art, game design, digital cultural heritage protection and other fields. I have a further understanding of the application value of my major",
              testcardtext2:"Social science is often described as an 'island discipline,' and I used to be anxious about getting a job. Although I have always been passionate about psychology and its theories, I have always felt limited by its traditional application. At MEGA's big game sharing session, the experience of industry seniors changed my previous view on psychological applications. Now, I prefer to combine my knowledge with the individual community. Provide a tailored framework of psychological resources for each marginalized group.",
              testcardtext3:"I fully enjoyed teaming up with people from diverse cultural, ethnic, and national backgrounds. Through having cross-cultural conversations, I was able to construct a new view on some universal subjects that I thought I understood before — like poverty, climate action, and gender equality. It was interesting to consider the perspectives and philosophies to these issues on a global scale.",

At the same time, everyone had amazing work ethics which inspired me to do better…my teammates were an indispensable part of my experience.
